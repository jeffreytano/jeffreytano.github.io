### HKExpress free ticket notes

- Prepare personal information
  - Name (C & E)
  - Tel. no.
  - email address
  - credit card number
  - HKID
  - passport number (just in case)
- Plan your flight by checking the flight with vacancy
- Set up priority of which option for fast decision
- **Queuing system will be applied, so queue as early as possible**

### Go Japan in non-populated season may result in cheaper ticket, hotel fee and higher accessability, just cost you a few more annual leave quota.

Buying JP cheap airlines ticket when return also considerable

## Preparation Checklist

1. Water Bottle
   - Used to get water in airport
   - Container for drinks if share a large volume drinks
2. transformer and 拖板 and wires
3. 頸枕
   - Used to slept when traveling
4. Entertainer
   - wired earphone
   - books
   - downloaded anime in laptop
   - hand grip
5. Passport and identifier (hand carry)
6. 指甲鉗
7. Outwear
   - keep yourself warm

### Luggage weight

Personally only need 20kg package since last time return only 15.9kg (15.7 for W)

Try not to early check-in so that we may get a row of adj. seats

Low chance to get front seat (experienced in 26/6)

**Arrive time estimate** \
Go flight - officially 0915 → 1445, delayed 1005(HKT) → 1610(JPT), reach hotel 1800(JPT) \
i.e. Reach hotel time - est. landing time (inc. delay time) = around 4h (if transport available after landing)

Back flight - officially 1545 → 1940(JPT), delayed 1600(JPT) → 1917(HKT), get luggages 2016(HKT) \
\*note that the back flight land in 3th runway and spent 20 mins after landing \

Personal comment: 0915 not really a BiS time, turn out free at 1800 in Japan, sleep more before the day and start flight at around 0400 maybe the best if viable. \
Which means wake up at 0000 and get out at 0100 and arrive airport at 0200. \
1545 take off JP maybe good enough if you need to work next day.

## After arrived

#### 成田空港編

**Option 1: Skyliner (Expensive)** 　\
Faster and assigned seat

- 2570 円 for each if bought in 成田空港
- 2262 円 for each if bought in HKExpress with 88% discount (26/6/2023 updated)

**Option 2: 京成-成田 Skyaccess (Cheaper)** \
No guaranteed seat but IC card available

- ~1257 円 for each to 京成上野

Guideline: \
成田 → 京成高砂 （京成-成田 Skyaccess/橙色線）　\
京成高砂 → 京成上野 （京成/藍色線）
