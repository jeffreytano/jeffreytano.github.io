I am a undergraduate student in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, major in Internet and Multimedia Technology.
Most of my courses were studying signal processing and programming. I experienced C++, C#, Java, Pascal, Python.
My final year project is Fast Algorithms for Versatile Video Coding,  it is basically training a machine learning model (deep learning model) for a video encoder, trying to skip some unlikely options for it to speed up the video encoding process.

Also, as a enthusiast of Japanese culture, I learn Japenese by mostly self studying and barely able to communicate in Japanese.
Watching anime and streams from both Japan and NA is my daily entertainment.  I would say my english and japanese are getting better just because of watching streams.
